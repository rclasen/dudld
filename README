dudld:
======

networked jukebox using data from dudl DB.

Database access:
================

depends on how you've setup your dudl database:

a) default ident-based access where you create matching unix and Postgress
users:
 - adduser --system dudld
 - echo "user=dudld" >> /etc/default/dudld

b) authenticate on DB connect. The default config is setup for this.

TODO: this should actually describe what dudld does
